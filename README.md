# HEVSuitMod

This mod will eventually bring Half-Life's HEV suit (and hopefully, many other things) to Escape From Tarkov (SPT or Official mod support if possible after 1.0).
Currently this is only in the concept stage.

Please see https://github.com/landonk89/HEVSuitAssets for the related asset files for this mod.

Right now, this is very early in development. A few things work but it's buggy and unfinished.

I am only slightly higher than a beginner when it comes to modding and coding in general, so I need to learn a lot
more about Unity and EFT's systems to make this all work the way I want. Any contributions or advice are welcome,
hopefully some talented people who love these two games as much as I do will stumble into this project and find interest!

The voice clips found in the 'sounds' directory are generated by VoxCPM using the original HEV voice from Half-Life
as a prompt/training file.

The 'sentences.txt' file in 'scripts' is used to define HEV sentences in a (loosely)similar way to Half-Life's original code.
See code comments and comments in sentences.txt to understand how it works.

There are some debugging keys: F7, F8, F9, F10
F7 will play a random compass direction voiceline
F8 will play the sentence name set in configuration manager (ex: HeavyBleeding).
F9 will play a randomly selected sentence from all sentences.
F10 will play a number sentence set in configuration manager (ex: 24, 250, 300, etc).
